# Flowingdata
Recreating the visuals from the book "Visualize This".

## Objective
Using only python libraries recreate the data in the book *Visualize This* by Nathan Yau.  The author generally provides example datasets to use in the visualization creation.  The targeted objective is to create his finished examples of good data visualization.

## File Organization
Files have been organized by Chapter where possible, although some cover multiple chapters.  In general, there are notes in the Jupyter notebooks used to recreate the visuals as closely as possible to those presented in the text.  

## Jupyter Notebooks
The entire effort for the Flowing Data visualization recreation is being conducted in Jupyter Notebooks.  This interface helped for learning, allowed for notetaking, and was much more readily used for trial and error testing.
